## SMS Checker / Frontend

Application service with frontend and backend for SMS checker
The frontend allows users to interact with the model in the backend through a web-based UI.

The frontend is implemented with Spring Boot and only consists of a website and one REST endpoint.
It **requires Java 25+** to run (tested with 25.0.1).
Any classification requests will be delegated to the `backend` service that serves the model.
You must specify the environment variable `MODEL_HOST` to define where the backend is running.

The frontend service can be started through running the `Main` class (e.g., in your IDE) or through Maven (recommended):

    MODEL_HOST="http://localhost:8081" mvn spring-boot:run

The server runs on port 8080. Once its startup has finished, you can access [localhost:8080/sms](http://localhost:8080/sms) in your browser to interact with the application.
